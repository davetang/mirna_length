* Length of human, mouse, zebrafish, and nematode miRNAs from miRBase
* Check di-nucleotide frequencies at specific positions in the miRNAs
* Generate Markov model using high confidence set of miRNAs
* Generate Markov model from the seed sequence of miRNAs
* Annotate where random sequences are mapping to in the genome
